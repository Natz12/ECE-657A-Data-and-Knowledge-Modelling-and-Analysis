# ECE 657A Data and Knowledge Modelling and Analysis
Class exercises, homework and assignments

## Homeworks
1. Homework 1: Data Summarization (Summary statistics, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Histograms)
2. Homework 2: Data Normalization (min-max, z-score, mean subtracted) and datapoint distance (Manhattan, euclidean, cosine)
3. Homework 3: Eigenvector Decomposition (PCA)
4. Homework 4: Data Classification using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Assignments
1. Assignment 1: Using two datasets, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, feature extraction and nonlinear dimensionality reduction.

  Dataset A : A time-series dataset collected from a set of motion sensors for wearable activity recognition. The data is given in time order, with 19,000 samples and 81 features. Used for data cleaning and preprocessing techniques. 
  
  Dataset B : Handwritten digits of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (5 classes). This dataset represent a 28 x 28 gray-scale (0-255) image of the digit by containing 2066 samples with 784 features, arranged in column-wise. This data is used to show the difference between feature extraction methods.
  
2. Assignment 2: Using two datasets, perform data preprocessing, splitting, and classification. The classification algorithms that to be used are: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Networks, k Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine (wirh RBF kernel) experimenting with the parameter selection. Produce confusion matrices and compare.

  Data set A: The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be  subscribed ('yes') or not ('no'). 
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y). The dataset is available at the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

  Data set B: This data is the splice junctions on DNA sequences. The given dataset includes 2200 samples with 57 features. It is a binary class problem. The class labels are either +1 or -1 and are given in the last column.
