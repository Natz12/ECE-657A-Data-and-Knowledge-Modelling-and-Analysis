# ECE 657A Data and Knowledge Modelling and Analysis
Class exercises, homework and assignments

## Homeworks
1. Homework 1: Data Summarization (Summary statistics, Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Histograms)
2. Homework 2: Data Normalization (min-max, z-score, mean subtracted) and datapoint distance (Manhattan, euclidean, cosine)
3. Homework 3: Eigenvector Decomposition (PCA)
4. Homework 4: Data Classification using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Assignments
1. Assignment 1: Using 2 datasets, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, feature extraction and nonlinear dimensionality reduction.

Sources:

  Dataset A : A time-series dataset collected from a set of motion sensors for
wearable activity recognition. The data is given in time order, with 19,000 samples and 81
features. Used for data cleaning and preprocessing techniques. 

  Dataset B : Handwritten digits of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (5 classes). This dataset represent a 28 x 28 gray-scale (0-255) image of the digit by containing 2066 samples with 784 features, arranged in column-wise. This data is used to show the difference between feature extraction methods.
